# Professional Development

Each week you will be expected to complete a series of lab activities in your two lab sessions. You will be required to reflect on these in your assignment so make sure you keep records of what you have done. You should refer to [this week's presentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1maN7cEkJXG__t6YWewKS0CRNGLpGPmmDgYxusmk7LRA).

## 1 Teams

The agile teams have been set up to contain students with the range of skills needed to complete the module. Each team is named after an animal. Check the [team list](teams/README.md) to find out which team you have been assigned to and which lab slots you will need to attend (these should also be shown on your University timetable).

1. Each team needs a catch phrase! Discuss and agree one for your team.
2. Early on in the _first lab session_ email any members of your team who have not turned up to remind them to attend. It it very important that you meet up _every scheduled lab_ to avoid falling behind!

## 2 Project

Read the [assignment brief](README.md) carefully to understand the scope of the group project. Ask your _lab supervisors_ if you have any questions. The product is only worth **10%** of your final grade however the skills and knowledge you acquire by completing the weekly lab worksheets will be needed to complete the reflective report (50%) and revise for the exam (40%). The winning team will be entered in the West Midlands [Urban Challenge](https://urbanchallenge.io) competition in the Well Being category so make sure you are aware of the entry requirements.

## 3 Skills Audit

Perform a detailed analysis of the problem you are going to solve and perform a Skills Audit on your team. There are a list of generic skills listed in the presentation which you will need to supplement with skills related to your choice of project. use this [skills list](exercises/01_prof_dev/README.md) as a starting point.

Create a **Team Competency Matrix** using a simple **Red-Amber-Green** (RAG) scale as shown in the lecture. This should include skills taken from the [skills list](exercises/01_prof_dev/README.md) provided plus any others you feel might be useful.

Refine the matrix using a 5 point scale.

## 4 Professional Development Plan

Working together develop a **Professional Development Plan** for each team member, identifying what they need to learn before the start of the development process in week 4. This will be reviewed during the **week 3 lab**. If any member of the team don't complete the tasks in their development plan by week 4 there is a risk _the project will fail!_ The plan should include:

1. What they need to learn.
2. Why they need to learn it
3. How they will learn:
    1. taught by another member of the team.
    2. learn using specified online resources (list these).
    3. learn from specific chapters of suitable books.

You can find some useful [learning resources](exercises/04_agile_dev/) in this repository.

## 5 Team Psychology

You have been introduced to a number of important (and potentially interesting?) areas of psychology that relate to group behaviour. As a group:

1. Discuss the 'symptoms' of each (what should you be looking out for)?
2. What is the short-term impact on the team?
3. If not addressed what might be the longer-term impact? Is it recoverable at this stage?
4. What can be done to _prevent_ this from ocurring?
5. What can be done to recover it it occurs?

## 6 LinkedIn

Use this information gained in the previous section to update your LinkedIn Profile. Having one of these will improve your chances of getting a good graduate job.

1. Add a suitable professional profile picture
2. Update the education section.
3. Add any skills that you have mastered to SfIA level 4 or above.
4. Download your CV as a PDF.
5. Use the search bar at the top of the screen to locate your other team members and add them to your profile.
6. Repeat for other people in the group.
7. Install LinkedIn on your smartphone...

## 7 Preparation

You will need to ensure your skills are up to date before we begin preparation in week 3.

### 7.1 Sensors and microcontrollers

1. plug in the ESP8266 and get the LED to flash
2. Try to connect the ESP8266 to the `ECL-LEGO-ROBOTS` wifi network.
3. Create an onboard counter on the ESP8266
4. Publish the counter to [Adafruit](https://io.adafruit.com/)

### 7.2 API Team

1. Subscribe to an MQTT data feed on [Adafruit](https://io.adafruit.com/) using NodeJS and print data to terminal. There is a good [online tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io/mqtt-api) to get you started.
2. Build an MQTT server. Heroku offer a [free hosting option](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cloudmqtt)

### 7.3 Front End
