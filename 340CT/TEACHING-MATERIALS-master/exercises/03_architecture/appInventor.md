# Using App Inventor

Whilst you are free to build your client using whatever language and platform you wish you might consider using App Inventor as it will allow you to build an Android App without needing to know a programming language (but you will still need to understand how to use App Inventor and the logic you are trying to implement!).

## Installation

You will need to install the latest version of the App Inventor software which will provide a simulator for testing and debugging the app. If you have an Android phone you will be able to run the app on it. The setup files are located at http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup-emulator.html
