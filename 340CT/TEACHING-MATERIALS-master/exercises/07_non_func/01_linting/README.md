# Tools to Manage Software Complexity

There are two important tools to help you manage software complexity.

1. A **Complexity Analysis** tool provides metrics on the complexity (and maintainability) of your code.
2. A **Linter** allows you to enforce rules to help reduce the complexity (and improve maintainability).

You should use both tools in your project.

| Language          | Complexity Analysis         | Linting   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | --------- |
| NodeJS/JavaScript |	complexity-report           | ESLint    |
| C++               | -                           | CPPLint   |
| Python            |	radon                       | pylint    |
| Java              |	metrics (an Eclipse plugin) | pmd       |
| Swift             |	taylor                      | SwiftLint |
| PHP               | PHPMetrics                  | phpcs     |
